# Contributing

Motivation:

* We want a kind of Wiki where any cluster member can easily share technical resources
* github provides a good solution to authentication and versioning -- easy to give members direct access
* This page is complementary to the official RIG Webpage: This one focus on listing/linking resources that we want to share among us and the research community; the official RIG webpage is flashy and to the publish
* This uses the default way (jekyll + just-the-docs) to create a githubio documentation/resources page with focus on good search and indexing (but any other gihub pages theme/system would do equally)
