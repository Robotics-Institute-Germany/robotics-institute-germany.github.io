# RIG Research Cluster on Learning & Multi-Modal AI

Speakers:
[Rudolf Lioutikov](https://www.irl.iar.kit.edu/team_58.php) (KIT) and
[Marc Toussaint](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/) (TU Berlin)

## Mission

We lay the foundations to bring modern AI and Machine Learning to Robotics.

Our research and Technical Committees focuses on fundamental methods (e.g. Optimization, (Reinforcement) Learning, guarantees) and foundation models (VLAs, neuro-symbolic methods) that are general-purpose applicable across robotic systems and tasks.
