# TC Foundations of Optimization and Learning for Robotics

Speakers:
[Majid Khadiv](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/khadiv-majid) (TU Munich) and
[Marc Toussaint](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/) (TU Berlin)

## Scope

Optimization and learning are at the core of robotics research and the recent success in robot learning. Traditionally, the fields of control theory, optimization-based planning, and modern imitation and generative model learning were segregated, although they share common foundations. Germany has excellent experts in each of these subfields – this TC is bringing these together, enabling them to develop unifying approaches and transferring ideas between the fields, and aiming to establish a theoretically-grounded framework for decision-making in robotic systems.
