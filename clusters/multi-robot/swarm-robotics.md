# RIG TC on Swarm Robotics

Spokesperson: [Heiko Hamann](https://heikohamann.de/) (University of Konstanz)

## Scope

This cluster focuses on scalable methods to control and coordinate multi-robot systems. Our focus is on (partially or fully) decentralized large-scale collaborative systems of mobile robots in any domain (land onroad and land offroad, air, water surface, underwater, space) that obtain maximal scalability and robustness. Methods can be biologically inspired or follow an engineering approach. Interesting real-world applications are (indoor) logistics, environmental/urban monitoring, surveillance, precision farming, etc. Topics of interest include:

- Self-organizing methods for coordination and collaboration (e.g., task allocation, formation control)
- Collective decision-making
- Scalability and congestion management (with applications to MAPF)
- Resilience and fault tolerance
- Collective perception
- Energy-aware swarm navigation
- Real-world deployment challenge
- Benchmarking of large-scale robot systems
- (decentralized) Large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
- Evolutionary swarm robotics
- Information-theoretic control and intrinsic motivation for collective motion/behavior
- Bio-hybrid systems and cyborgs
