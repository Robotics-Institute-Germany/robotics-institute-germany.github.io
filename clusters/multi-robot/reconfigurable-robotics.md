# RIG TC on Reconfigurable Robotics

Spokesperson: [Malte Wirkus](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/de/ueber-uns/mitarbeiter/person/mawi05) (DFKI)

## Scope

The cluster is concerned with reconfigurable robotic systems that can be adapted to specific tasks with modular payloads. Individual developments in different application areas such as agriculture, construction, S&R and space will be recognized and supported to coordinate and advance technology development by exploiting synergies between application areas.

Therefore, the cluster aims to establish a cross-application research community in modular mobile robotics to foster information exchange through joint publications, workshops and the development and validation of technology demonstrators. This exchange should accelerate both standardization processes and the achievement of higher technology maturity.

The goal of the cluster is to make robots more versatile by creating an ecosystem for robot tool developers and establishing intelligent mobile robot payloads and services as an industry. The cluster sees itself as an overarching authority to harmonize and guide the respective research and development in the target application domains and to contribute with technology proposals, demonstrators and standardization efforts.

Topics of interest include:
- Multifunctional Interfaces
    - Mechanical and electronic interfaces
    - Modular end effectors
- Payload modules
    - Software APIs and services for extensible robots
    - Smart robot payload items
- Planning and control for reconfigurable robot systems
    - Reconfigurable control software for robots with varying capabilities
    - Configuration planning
    - Docking control
    - Evolving robot morphology
- Multi robot systems
    - Collaborating and transformable robot systems
