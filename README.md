# RIG Community Webpage

The [Robotics Institute Gemany](https://robotics-institute-germany.de/) (RIG) connects leading experts and talents in science, academia, and the industry to foster cutting-edge research, groundbreaking technologies, and transformative applications.

This is the source repo of https://robotics-institute-germany.github.io/, the Community Webpage of RIG. Members of RIG use this to share resources and information, e.g. concerning robotics software, hardware, education, infrastructure, publications, and robotics research in Germany. Please become a member of the [RIG github organization](https://github.com/robotics-institute-germany) to contribute.

Technically, it uses Jekyll and cloned the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/) template.
