## Acknowledging RIG

This is how we should acknowledge funding in papers:

	This work has been supported by German Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) under the Robotics Institute Germany (RIG).

## Contributing to this page

Motivation for this page:

* With this page any cluster member can easily share technical resources
* github provides a good solution to authentication and versioning -- easy to give members direct access
* This page is complementary to the official RIG Webpage: This one focus on listing/linking resources that we want to share among us and the research community; the official RIG webpage is for the general public, with restricted CMS
* This page currently uses the default way (jekyll + just-the-docs) to create a githubio documentation/resources page with focus on good search and indexing (but any other gihub pages theme/system would do equally)
* Contact us to get invited to the [RIG github organization](https://github.com/robotics-institute-germany) to contribute.
